# THEME
It's October, and we all know what that means.  PUMPKINS!  Pumpkin Pies, Pumpkin patches and more!  So we are making it a thanksgiving theme temporarily!
Basically a reskin, but also a special currency: PUMPKINS.  They can be used to trade with villagers to collect Rare fruit.

## OBJECTIVE
Your objective is to collect as much currency as possible by talking to villagers and completing quests and harvesting fruit.  You can trade in fruit for currency.

## CURRENCIES
The base currency is Gold; you get it by trading in fruit to villagers, and it is used to buy Mutts(Pets).
The rare currency is Pumpkin; obtainable by finishing October Quests.  It is used for October Cosmetics(Style your character and Mutt), and October Ranks.
The extreme currency is ROBUX; used to buy Pumpkin and Gold.
